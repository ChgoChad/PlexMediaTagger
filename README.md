thanks goes to:
the [Subler team](http://code.google.com/p/subler/), their CLI tool takes care of the actual embedding of the information.
the [Plex team](http://www.plexapp.com), their PMS takes care of all the hard work of gathering the metadata and providing an intuitive web API to browse the local library.
